### [Assignments - PDF](https://github.com/somphene/geometric-analysis/Assignments%20-%20PDF)
This contains eleven (11) files in total.  
It has individual PDFs of all the ten (10) assignments that we were given. (Including the 5 contained in Notes.pdf)  
The last file is the PDF containing all the assignments together.

### [Tests - PDF](https://github.com/somphene/geometric-analysis/Tests%20-%20PDF)
This contains the PDFs of the questions papers of the four (4) quizzes, midsems, and endsems.

### [Notes - LaTeX](https://github.com/somphene/geometric-analysis/Notes%20-%20LaTeX)
This folder contains the source files of all the notes (and the five assignments) which are named as LecXY.tex (and AssignXY.tex).  
In addition to these, there's a file named ''main.tex'', this is the file that is to be compiled.  
As you'll see, I've used the ```\input``` command to include the lecture files. This was done to have a cleaner source code.  
This also means that you cannot compile the lecture (and assignment) files independently as they don't have the required declarations.
