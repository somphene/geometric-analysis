### [Notes - LaTeX](https://github.com/somphene/geometric-analysis/Notes%20-%20LaTeX)
This folder contains the source files of all the notes (and the five assignments) which are named as LecXY.tex (and AssignXY.tex).  
In addition to these, there's a file named ''main.tex'', this is the file that is to be compiled.  
As you'll see, I've used the ```\input``` command to include the lecture files. This was done to have a cleaner source code.  
This also means that you cannot compile the lecture (and assignment) files independently as they don't have the required declarations.
